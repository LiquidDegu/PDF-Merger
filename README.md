# PDF-Merger
This program creates a simple tkinter window with a button that, when clicked, will open a file selection dialog where the user can select multiple PDF files to combine. When the user clicks "OK" in the file selection dialog, the selected PDFs will be combined using the PyPDF2 library and saved as a new file called "combined_pdf.pdf". A message will be displayed to let the user know that the PDFs were combined successfully.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
